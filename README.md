Bower support for Rails projects. Dependency file is bower.json in Rails root dir or Bowerfile if you use DSL.
Check out [changelog][] for the latest changes and releases.

[changelog]: https://github.com/42dev/bower-rails/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md

**Requirements**

* [node](http://nodejs.org) ([on github](https://github.com/joyent/node))
* [bower](https://github.com/bower/bower) (>= 0.10.0) installed with npm

NOTE: If you install `node` via package manager with `sudo apt-get install nodejs` you'll also need to install `nodejs-legacy` with `sudo apt-get install nodejs-legacy`. See [#91](https://github.com/42dev/bower-rails/issues/91)

**Install**

in Gemfile

``` Ruby
  gem "bower-rails", "~> 0.10.0"
```

##JSON configuration

Bower-rails now supports the standard [bower package](https://github.com/bower/bower#defining-a-package) format out-of-the-box. Simply place your bower.json file the Rails root directory to start. Using the standard format will default all bower components to be installed under the `vendor` directory.

To install dependencies into both `lib` and `vendor` directories, run the initializer to generate a custom bower.json:

``` Bash
  rails g bower_rails:initialize json
```

This will generate a `config/initializers/bower_rails.rb` config file and a special bower.json that combines two standard bower packages into one. Simply specify your dependencies under each folder name to install them into the corresponding directories.

**example bower.json file**

``` javascript
{
   "lib": {
    "name": "bower-rails generated lib assets",
    "dependencies": {
      "threex"      : "git@github.com:rharriso/threex.git",
      "gsvpano.js"  : "https://github.com/rharriso/GSVPano.js/blob/master/src/GSVPano.js"
    }
  },
  "vendor": {
    "name": "bower-rails generated vendor assets",
    "dependencies": {
      "three.js"    : "https://raw.github.com/mrdoob/three.js/master/build/three.js"
    }
  }
}
```

##Ruby DSL configuration

The Ruby DSL configuration is a Bowerfile at the project's root with DSL syntax similar to Bundler.

Run the initializer to generate a sample Bowerfile inside the Rails root and a `config/initializers/bower_rails.rb` config file:

``` Bash
  rails g bower_rails:initialize
```

**Example Bowerfile**

By default assets are put to `./vendor/assets/bower_components` directory:

``` ruby

# Puts to ./vendor/assets/bower_components
asset "backbone"
asset "moment", "2.0.0" # get exactly version 2.0.0
asset "secret_styles", "git@github.com:initech/secret_styles" # get from a git repo

# get from a git repo using the tag 1.0.0
asset "secret_logic", "1.0.0", git: "git@github.com:initech/secret_logic"

# get from a github repo
asset "secret_logic", "1.0.0", github: "initech/secret_logic"

# get a specific revision from a git endpoint
asset "secret_logic", github: "initech/secret_logic", ref: '0adff'

# get a single file
asset "three.js", "https://raw.github.com/mrdoob/three.js/master/build/three.js"
```

But the default value can be overridden by `assets_path` method:

``` ruby
assets_path "assets/my_javascripts"

# Puts to ./vendor/assets/my_javascripts/bower_components
asset "backbone"
asset "moment"
```

The `assets_path` method can be overridden by an option in a `group` call:

``` ruby
assets_path "assets/javascript"

# Puts files under ./vendor/assets/js/bower_components
group :vendor, :assets_path => "assets/js"  do
  asset "jquery"            # Defaults to 'latest'
  asset "backbone", "1.1.1"
end

# Puts files under ./lib/assets/javascript/bower_components
group :lib do
  asset "jquery"
  asset "backbone", "1.1.1"
end
```
NOTE: Available groups are `:lib` and `:vendor`. Others are not allowed according to the Rails convention.
NOTE: All the assets should be stored in `/assets` subdirectory so putting it under `./vendor/js` directory is unavailable

You can extend `main` directive to include some missing files using `main_files` 
option as parameter or in a block:

``` ruby
# via argument
asset "moment", "2.10.1", main_files: ["./locale/en-gb.js"]

# or in block
asset "moment", "2.10.1" do
  main_files [
    "./locale/en-gb.js",
    "./locale/fr.js",
    "./locale/lv.js"
  ]
end
```

And finally, you can specify the assets to be in the devDependencies block:

``` ruby
asset "backbone", "1.1.1"

# Adds jasmine-sinon and jasmine-matchers to devDependencies
dependency_group :dev_dependencies  do
  asset "jasmine-sinon"            # Defaults to 'latest'
  asset "jasmine-matchers"         # Defaults to 'latest'
end

# Explicit dependency group notation ( not neccessary )
dependency_group :dependencies  do
  asset "emberjs"                  # Defaults to 'latest'
end
```
results in the following bower.json file:

```
{
  "name": "dsl-generated dependencies",
  "dependencies": {
    "backbone": "1.1.1"
    "angular": "1.2.18",
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "jasmine-sinon": "latest",
    "jasmine-matchers": "latest"
  }
}
```
NOTE: Available dependency groups are `:dependencies` (default) and `:dev_dependencies`. Others are not allowed according to the Rails convention.

## Bower Resolutions

To specify a [bower resolution][] use `resolution` DSL method in your Bowerfile:

```ruby
resolution "angular", "1.2.22"
```

That will produce `bower.json` like:

``` javascript
{
  "name" : "dsl-generated dependencies",
  "dependencies" : {
    "angular" : "1.2.22"
  },
  "resolutions": {
    "angular": "1.2.22"
  }
}
```

[bower resolution]: http://jaketrent.com/post/bower-resolutions/

##Configuration

Change options in your `config/initializers/bower_rails.rb`:

``` ruby
BowerRails.configure do |bower_rails|
  # Tell bower-rails what path should be considered as root. Defaults to Dir.pwd
  bower_rails.root_path = Dir.pwd

  # Invokes rake bower:install before precompilation. Defaults to false
  bower_rails.install_before_precompile = true

  # Invokes rake bower:resolve before precompilation. Defaults to false
  bower_rails.resolve_before_precompile = true

  # Invokes rake bower:clean before precompilation. Defaults to false
  bower_rails.clean_before_precompile = true

  # Invokes rake bower:install:deployment instead rake bower:install. Defaults to false
  bower_rails.use_bower_install_deployment = true

  # Passes the -F option to rake bower:install or rake bower:install:deployment. Defaults to false.
  bower_rails.force_install = true

  # Raises exception if bower install needs to be run. Defaults to false
  bower_rails.check_pending = true
end
```

If you are using Rails version < 4.0.0 then you are to require `bower_rails.rb` initializer manually in `application.rb`:

```ruby
module YourAppName
  class Application < Rails::Application
    require "#{Rails.root}/config/initializers/bower_rails.rb"
    ...
  end
end
```

By default this line is added while running the generator.

##Rake tasks

Once you are done with `bower.json` or `Bowerfile` you can run

* `rake bower:install` to install packages
* `rake bower:install:deployment` to install packages from bower.json
* `rake bower:update` to update packages
* `rake bower:update:prune` to update components and uninstall extraneous packages
* `rake bower:list` to list all packages
* `rake bower:clean` to remove all files not listed as [main files](#bower-main-files) (if specified)
* `rake bower:resolve` to resolve [relative asset paths](#relative-asset-paths) in components
* `rake bower:cache:clean` to clear the bower cache. This is useful when you know a component has been updated. 

If you'd like to pass any bower CLI options to a rake task, like `-f`, `-j`, you can simply do:

```bash
rake bower:install['-f']
```

##Capistrano 3 Configuration

While using Capistrano 3 and Capistrano Rails gem, it's needed to run bower install before assets compile. Add the following code to your deploy.rb, it will run `rake bower:install` before compiling the assets. CI=true flag is used not to ask for the analytics at the first bower install.

```
namespace :bower do
  desc 'Install bower'
  task :install do
    on roles(:web) do
      within release_path do
        execute :rake, 'bower:install CI=true'
      end
    end
  end
end
before 'deploy:compile_assets', 'bower:install'
```

##Bower Configuration

If you provide a `.bowerrc` in the rails project root, bower-rails will use it for bower configuration.
Some .bowerrc options are not supported: `directory`, `cwd`, and `interactive`. Bower-rails
will ignore the `directory` property and instead will use the automatically generated asset path.

###Bower Installation

[Bower](https://github.com/bower/bower) should be installed using npm. Bower can be installed globally (with `$ npm install -g bower`) or in `node_modules` in the root directory of your project.

##Relative asset paths

Some bower components (eg. [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/0016c17f9307bc71fc96d8d4680a9c861f137cae/dist/css/bootstrap.css#L2263)) have relative urls in the CSS files for imports, images, etc. Rails prefers using [helper methods](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html#coding-links-to-assets) for linking to assets within CSS. Relative paths can cause issues when assets are precompiled for production.

Remember that you should have [bower installed](#bower-installation) either locally in your project or on a remote server.

##Bower Main Files

Each bower component should follow the [bower.json spec](https://github.com/bower/bower.json-spec) 
which designates a recommended `main` directive that lists the primary files of 
that component. You may choose to reference these files if you are using the asset 
pipeline, in which case other extraneous includes of the bower component are not needed. 
The `rake bower:clean` task removes every file that isn't listed in the `main` directive, 
if the component specifies a `main` directive. Remember that you can extend the `main` directive
in [ruby DSL configuration](#ruby-dsl-configuration). Otherwise, the library will remain as bower installed it. It supports wildcards 
in files listed in `main` directive.
